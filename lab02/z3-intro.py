# Z3 is an SMT solver. In this lecture, we'll discuss
# the basis usage of Z3 through some working example, the
# primary goal is to introduce how to use Z3 to solve
# the satisfiability problems we've discussed in the past
# several lectures.
# We must emphasize that Z3 is just one of the many such SMT
# solvers, and by introducing Z3, we hope you will have a
# general understanding of what such solvers look like, and
# what they can do.

# Basic propositional logic

# In Z3, we can declare two propositions just as booleans, this
# is rather natural, for propositions can have values true or false.
# To declare two propositions P and Q:
P = Bool('P')
Q = Bool('Q')
# or, we can use a more compact shorthand:
P, Q = Bools('P Q')


# We can build propositions by writing Lisp-style abstract
# syntax trees, for example, the disjunction:
# P \/ Q
# can be encoded as the following AST:
F = Or(P, Q)
# Output is : Or(P, Q)
print(F)

# Note that the connective '\/' is called 'Or' in Z3, we'll see
# several other in the next.

# We have designed the function 'pretty_print(expr)' for you, 
# As long as we input the expression defined by z3, we can output 
# propositions that are suitable for us to read.
# Here‘s an example:

P, Q = Bools('P Q')
F = Or(P, Q)

# Output is : P \/ Q
pretty_print(F)

# quantifier. ∀ x.P (x) means that for any x, P (x) holds,

# IntSort(): Return the integer sort in the given context.
